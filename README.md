# Start Over 
This is my entry for the [js13kgames](https://js13kgames.com/) 2019 challenge.

Start Over is a puzzle platformer that when the player restarts the level, they keep clones of their old tries.

This repo is a clone of the [js13k-boilerplate](https://github.com/ooflorent/js13k-boilerplate)
 by ooflorent.

 The background art was made by [Maytch](https://maytch.itch.io/).

Expect a lot of spaghetti code.
